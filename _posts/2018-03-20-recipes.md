It's time to make dinner. But what can I make with the few things left in the fridge?
When in search of inspiration there is nothing better than getting suggestions from your laptop.

That's the plan, very simple. Give in input a list of ingredients and get back an idea, the name of a dish 
that could possibly be made with them. Using a generative model we could even find novel recipes, 
might be helping us find to a dish that valorizes one of those new food pairings we discovered last time.

## Data overview

How do we get there in practice? I decided to code an RNN, with a vector to sequence model.
Technically speaking I used as starting point the [Keras code](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_seq2seq.py) from their [introduction to seq2seq](https://blog.keras.io/a-ten-minute-introduction-to-sequence-to-sequence-learning-in-keras.html).
I took parts of it and coded all the necessary modifications and additions. The final network architecture is relatively straightforward and,
as often the case, a picture is worth a thousand words so here is a cartoon of it

The input is a list of ingredients in the form of a one hot encoded vector. It is passed through a dense
layer to reduce its dimensionality from ~500 to 32 and used as the initial hidden state of a GRU with softmax activation. 
The recurrent layer takes the title of the recipe as input, trying to predict the title itself (so using "teacher forcing").
The title representation is word level, with a word encoding of dimension ~4000.
The whole network is trained on a list of almost 200k recipes, that I selected from the [MIT recipe dataset](http://im2recipe.csail.mit.edu/)
after cleaning the ingredient list, mostly by requiring title length between 3 and 7 words, no uncommon words in the title.

My laptop was really slow so I switched to [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), this two guides were very useful.
Training took a few hours for a total of 200 epochs on a p2.xlarge instance. 
After training we can generate new recipe titles. Each word is chosen among the top 5 most probable ones predicted 
by the network and used as an input to predict the next one.  

## Results

With no further ado here are some results. First we can check that conditioning on common ingredient
lists returns reasonable titles. For instance given the chicken parm ingredients (*"chicken, parmesan, mozzarella, tomato, basil..."*) from the graph in the previous post
the suggestions are  
- Mozzarella Basil Stuffed Chicken Thighs
- Chicken Parmigiana Pie With Basil
- Mozzarella Parmesan Bruschetta With Chicken Breasts  

among others. For the other list in the previous post, the peanut butter brownies (*"chocolate, peanut butter, butter, eggs, sugar, vanilla, flour"*), the silicon chef recommends:
- Chewy Peanut Chocolate Cookies
- Peanut Butter Brownies In Chocolate Chip Sauce
- Double Fudge Cookies With Chocolate Peanut Butter

Not too bad!

Now we can try something more original. For instance given just *"crab, milk and chocolate"* the code offers for dinner:
- Chocolate Crabmeat Pudding
- Hot Crab And Chocolate Soup

Of course some disastrous results appear too, here are just a couple of them:
- Of Those Back De Tails 
- Wrapped Of The Best To Your Day Cookies For Tacos Ever

It was nevertheless fun to code. Please leave comments, feedback is always welcome. 
There is room for improvement and other things left to do, but any suggestion is helpful.

## What's next?

Bigger training set and cleaner one are the first things to come to mind.
It is clear from the results that there is some sort of overtraining. Optimization of the architecture should help too.

I'm planning to put online an app to let everybody enjoy the results.
Finally it would be interesting to expand the code to generate not only titles but whole recipes with instructions.
